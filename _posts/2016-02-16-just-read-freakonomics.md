The second non-fiction book that I've tackled this year has been Freakenomics.  As it turns out and by complete accident, it actually ended up being remarkably similar to Predictably Irrational which I read in January.

###Review

Overall, a good book with some good arguments and interesting deep-dives, particularly into the topics of drugs and abortion.  One thing that turned me off a bit to the book (unfairly), is that many of the studies which were cited in the book were the same ones which had been cited in Predictably Irrational.  In reality, I believe it's the other book which copied Freakonomics, however due to the order in which I read the books, I have a more positive impression of the former.

###Summary and Key Concepts

1.  Economics of drugs.

    I found it really interesting to read about the economics involved in the ground-level drug trade.  The sale of drugs has been largely romanticized by the media (movies, books, tv) and drug dealers are portrayed (aside from going to jail) as living idillic and very wealthy lives.  What Freakonomics dives into is why, if that's the case, do so many drug dealers end up living with their parents?

2.  Abortion leading to a drop in crime rates

    Similar to Predictably Irrational, Freakonomics dives very deeply into the relationship between abortion and crime rates.  The difference is that Freakonomics also takes a much closer look at all of the other things which could have - but didn't - cause a drop in crime.  There are several key takeaways which I saw here:

          1.  Increased numbers of police account for a large percentage of drops in crime.
          2.  Abortion rates do indeed cause a very large drop in crime 15-20 years later because of the situations into which children aren't being born.
          3.  From an economic perspective, you can argue both in favor and against abortion as the number of crimes prevented isn't actually higher than the number of abortions - so it really depends on what point you define someone as being alive (conception or later).  As a result...this isn't really an economic conversation, but an idealogical.
