Three (working) days ago, I decided that I wanted to try out using Jekyll.  About 3 real days ago [my personal blog](https://www.andreyryazanov.com "andreyryazanov.com") went down for some unknown reason - my guess is that my domain registrar changed something on their end without warning me.  Rather than bothering to try and resurrect that site, given that I didn't have all that much content on it anyway, I decided to use the opportunity to rebuild my blog as a static website.

###The Results

In about 12 hours, all told, I was able to read through all of the Jekyll documentation and figure out how to use GitHub pages as a hosting provider.  Luckily both were pretty simple to do.  The result, is what you see before you.  Not the most elegant design in the world, but it's clean and easy to navigate.  Additionally, but About page still needs a whole lot of work to make it really presentable.

###Next Steps

I'm going to try and actually keep up with publishing blog posts this time around, as well as continue improving on the design and content of this website.  My new system is very user friendly and I can easily reproduce the environment on any other Mac simply by pulling my github repo into it.
