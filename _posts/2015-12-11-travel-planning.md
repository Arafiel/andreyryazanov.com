<p>Many people struggle with planning vacations that don’t revolve around a cruise, all-inclusive resort, or a pre-made itinerary and tour group.  I’m here to tell you that none of these are necessary.  In fact, all booking your vacation through any of those options will do is cheapen your experience and give you a ‘tourist’ view of whatever country you’re visiting.</p>

<p>Here’s what you should do to plan your own vacation instead.</p>
<u>1.  Pick a destination</u>
<p>This seems pretty obvious, but it’s also the first step in planning a proper vacation.  At this point you don’t need an itinerary…you don’t even need a specific place.  For example, my upcoming vacation started off as, “We want to go to Southeast Asia this summer” and went from there.</p>
<u>2.  Do some research</u>
<p>You picked a destination, great!  Now the tricky part - do you have a set time when you have to book your vacation?  Some parts of the world aren’t ideal for visiting at certain times of the year.</p> <p>Example:  Southeast Asia in the summer - it’s very hot, humid, and rains almost every day.</p>
<p>But wait, didn’t you just say that you’re going to Southeast Asia this summer?  Well, yes - for two reasons.
<ol>
<li>There WAS a set time period we had to go as one of our group members is a teacher and only has vacation time in the summers.</li>
<li>While conditions aren’t ideal, this also means that it’s the off-season for tourism there, resulting less tourists crowding sites and cheaper accommodations/air travel fares.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<u>3.  Where else?</u>
<p>If you’re going to to a far-off place and have some time to spare, it’s often worthwhile to go to more than one place.  I find that it’s usually good to plan 1 week per country if you have 2-3 weeks to play with, or 2-3 days per city/location otherwise.</p>
<p>Real life itinerary for my upcoming vacation:
<ul>
<li>4 days in Hanoi, Vietnam</li>
<li>2 days in Sa Pa, Vietnam</li>
<li>2 days in Bangkok, Thailand</li>
<li>3 days in Siem Reap, Cambodia</li>
<li>3 days in Rai Lay, Thailand</li>
<li>5 days in Chiang Mai, Thailand</li>
<li>1 day in Bangkok, Thailand, Thailand (encore before departure)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<u>4.  Book your to/from flights</u>
<p>Once you’ve settled on a time period and a start/end location, book your flights!  Typical it’s best to book on a Tuesday at least a couple of months in advance if you can manage it.  I’ll write a specific article on flight booking later on.  <br /><br /><b>Please note</b>:  At this point in time you don’t need a solid itinerary at your destination yet, nor do you need hotels or transportation within the countries - though you should do some basic research to make sure your start and end locations are feasible.</p>
<u>5.  So…where are you going?</u>
<p>Now that you have tickets, you can start figuring out where you’re going within your destination!  My itineraries tend to change several times throughout this process.  For example, in my upcoming trip we were initially considering going to 5 additional locations between Thailand and Vietnam but ended up cutting them out for a number of reasons:
<ul>
<li>Locations are too reliant on weather - we wanted to go to Ha Long Bay but decided since we’re going during rainy season we needed to un-plan this as rain on those specific dates would ruin the experience.</li>
<li>Locations are too far - make sure to plot out everywhere you want to go on a map (google maps works well for this) and see if anything is REALLY far off of your path.</li>
<li>Too many locations - it’s easy to get travel fatigue if you’re traveling every day.  To avoid this, make sure that you keep travel days to a bare minimum.  We’re doing this through a combination of fewer destinations and overnight trains.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<u>6. Book your inner-trip travel</u>
<p>You’re almost there!  You have an itinerary (you think)!  Time to book the flights, trains, cars, busses, etc.  I suggest using [Momondo](http://www.momondo.com "Momondo Flight Search") for searching for flights - their aggregation engine is phenomenal.  Make sure to find all of your flights first before doing the booking as this could change your order of travel.
<br /><br />
<b>Example:</b> In my upcoming Asia trip we were initially intending to travel from Vietnam -> Cambodia -> Thailand but discovered during flight research that all cheap flights from Hanoi have a layover in Bangkok before circling back to Cambodia, meaning that our itinerary made no sense.  We ended up changing our travel plans to reflect that, going from Vietnam, spending a few days in Bangkok, and only THEN traveling on to Cambodia.
</p>
<u>7. Plan, but don’t over plan</u>
<p>Having an idea of what you’re going to be doing in-country is great, but you don’t want to over-plan your itinerary.  You’ll want to figure out what sort of interesting things there are to do in each of the cities and destinations you’re going to be visiting, but oftentimes circumstances will dictate what you’re actually going to be able to (or want to) do.  For instance you might rigidly plan out your schedule to have a cruise on a certain day…and then it ends up raining.  Alternatively you might find out once you’re on the ground that there’s a big festival or event that’s going on that you really shouldn’t miss, but if you’ve planned every day exactly…are you going to be comfortable cutting out what you were going to see that day?</p>
<u>8. Relax, have fun</u>
<p>Ultimately, you’re going on vacation not a forced march.  Relax, have fun, don’t stress too much about the details once you have the basics squared away.</p>
