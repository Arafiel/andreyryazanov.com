Starting this year, I will be making an effort to catalogue all of my non-fiction book consumption in a standardized format in order to better codify my thoughts on the various books that I read, as well as create a written reminder of my key takeaways from certain books immediately after completing them.

##Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely

###Review

Great book, and one that I highly recommend for anyone that’s interested in marketing, psychology, product development, or product management.  While much of the content of the book is predictable in the sense that everything he states makes a lot of sense, Dan Ariely also provides great descriptions of the experiments that he and his collaborators ran in order to test their theories.  While I did walk away from reading the book with a certain number of unanswered questions and things that I thought he glossed over, I also had a lot of takeaways for my future product and marketing ventures.

###Summary and Key Concepts

1. Supply and demand is both a fallacy…and it isn’t.  Ariely uses the example of black pearls which were completely unknown as an object of jewelry and desire until one enterprising salesman convinced a prominent 5th Avenue store to feature them in its storefront alongside some of the most expensive gemstones and jewelry around.

  My takeaway from this:  When dealing with a brand new product category, it’s entirely possible to generate a demand for it at a given price, the main issue is getting people to associate a product with a given category - and covet it.

2. Zero Cost.  This was both an interesting concept in the book and one that I felt had some holes in it.  Dan Ariely argued that many times people will leap for the opportunity to pay nothing, even when there’s another option which is actually a better deal.  His example:  free Hershey’s Kiss vs paying 11 cents (a much bigger discount) for a truffle.  People chose the free kiss because…it was free.

  Dan Ariely seemed to argue that this was because there’s something magical about the word free and the human psyche.  I disagree however, thinking it’s more about the fact that humans as a whole are rather risk averse.  Paying even 1 cent for something is a risk as opposed to receiving something for free, which involves no monetary investment.

3. Social Norms vs Economic Norms.  This was one of the most interesting sections of the book to me, discussing how human behavior is different depending on whether money is involved or not.  Dan conducted a series of experiments where he asked people to work as a favor, versus paying them a tiny salary, versus paying them slightly more money…and learned that work for favors or out of social obligation tends to be of higher quality.  He also argued that many companies misunderstand this by trying to equate themselves to family/friends to people, however then mess up by failing to follow through and not treating customers as friends/family would in return (i.e. being lenient on missed payments or charging penalty fees for things).

4. Keeping doors open.  This is something I know that I’m very much guilty of.  In an experiment conducted in a silly video game, Dan Ariely tested whether people would min/max income if there was the risk of losing opportunities (even worse opportunities).  The conclusion was that people would go to extreme lengths to avoid losing potential options down the line - even if the loss of opportunity was temporary.

There were quite a few other interesting concepts in the book - the influence of arousal on decision making, the power of price, the power of expectations and the placebo effect, cash and honesty…and many others.  The four things that I listed above however, are the ones that I personally found most interesting and applicable to my life.
